# personal-scripts
Scripts I wrote for personal projects, or just for fun

# mattermost-birthday-bot
Script to wish someone a happy birthday on Mattermost every day of their birthday month.  Set to run daily at 2am.

# choose-your-own-adventure-shell 
The basics of an interactive python choose your own adventure story.  Just add a plot!

# refresh-internet
Had shared internet that kicked us off all the time, then had to go through the splash screen to reconnect.  
Wrote a script and ran it every 1 minute to prevent this from happening.
